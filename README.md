## Lab 1: Redundant Manipulators: Path Following and Obstacle Avoidance

**Objective:**  
1. **Kinematic Control:**  
   Control a redundant manipulator for smooth and accurate path following while ensuring real-time obstacle avoidance.
   
2. **Obstacle Avoidance:**  
   Implement algorithms to ensure the manipulator avoids obstacles in its environment while performing tasks.

3. **Path Tracking:**  
   Develop and simulate a trajectory that the manipulator will follow.

4. **Collaborative Safety:**  
   Ensure that the cobot operates safely in environments shared with humans, respecting the constraints of speed and applied force.

**Key Tasks:** 

- Implementing a kinematic control algorithm.
- Simulating the path following while avoiding obstacles using the Gazebo simulator.
- Visualizing the results and analyzing the system's performance.


## Lab 2: Mobile Robots-Wall Following

**Objective:**  
In this lab, the goal is to develop and implement a wall-following algorithm for a mobile robot. The robot should be capable of maintaining a constant distance from obstacles while navigating through an environment, using a combination of ultrasonic sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).

**Key Tasks:**

- Developing an obstacle-following algorithm.
- Simulating the robot's movement around obstacles while maintaining a set distance from the walls.
