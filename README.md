## Lab 1: Redundant Manipulators: Path Following and Obstacle Avoidance

**Objective:**  
1. **Kinematic Control:**  
   Control a redundant manipulator for smooth and accurate path following while ensuring real-time obstacle avoidance.
   
2. **Obstacle Avoidance:**  
   Implement algorithms to ensure the manipulator avoids obstacles in its environment while performing tasks.

3. **Path Tracking:**  
   Develop and simulate a trajectory that the manipulator will follow.

4. **Collaborative Safety:**  
   Ensure that the cobot operates safely in environments shared with humans, respecting the constraints of speed and applied force.


## Lab 2: Perceptual Audio Coding

**Objective:**  
In this lab, the goal is to compress an audio signal based on human auditory perception, focusing on critical frequency bands and psychoacoustic masking models.

**Key Tasks:**
1. **Psychoacoustic Model:**  
   Implement a perceptual audio coding model that takes advantage of psychoacoustic phenomena to reduce the size of audio files while preserving sound quality.
2. **Filterbank Analysis:**  
   Use filterbanks to analyze and reconstruct the signal, compressing the audio file and maintaining minimal perceptual loss.
